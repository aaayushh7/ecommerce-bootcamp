                    <h4>The people of Japan believe that everyone has an ikigai – a reason to jump out of bed each
                        morning. And according to the residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa – the world’s
                        longest-living people – finding it is the key to a longer and more fulfilled life. Inspiring and
                        comforting, this book will give you the life-changing tools to uncover your personal ikigai. It
                        will show you how to leave urgency behind, find your purpose, nurture friendships and throw
                        yourself into your passions.</h4><br> <br>
                    <h4>An important point to make about goals in relation to ikigai is the achievement of them is not
                        as important as the process and effort that goes into them. For many Japanese, Ikigai has an
                        inextricable link to a concept called kodawari, doing things properly with great attention to
                        detail. The dedication to a process and the commitment to progress is more important than the
                        achievement of any goal to practitioners of kodawari.</h4><br>
                    <h4>Also these goals don’t need to be impressive and driven by the ego. For many Japanese, their
                        ikigai can be the humble pursuit of a seemingly meaningless goal.

                    Your purpose doesn’t have to be tied to your career. I have many friends who told me they knew they
                    were
                    meant to have children before they even understood what it was to conceive. I’ve always believed
                    that
                    accepting the call to be a mother is the choice to become the ultimate spiritual teacher. Because
                    mothers live in service and sacrifice to their children.

                <h3>Understanding Ikigai</h3>
                <p>As previously mentioned, the biggest misconception of ikigai is that it is a sweet spot of our
                    professional life, where we achieve our one true purpose on a grand scale. We need to be careful
                    about how we think about our ikigai. It is not a destination or goal to achieve. It does encompass
                    goals, but with ikigai there is no destination. </p>
                <p>Ikigai is not about what you want out of life. Ikigai is about who you want to become - your
                    actualized
                    self. This is why ikigai is personal and also for many people private. And it is considered by some
                    Japanese as the most honorable thing one can do.</p>

                <h5>Feeling ikigai entails actions of devoting oneself to pursuits one enjoys and is associated with
                    feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment. Furthermore, it includes awareness of values such as the
                    purpose of life and the meaning of existence; it is future oriented, as in goal seeking.

                <h5>Also, Ikigai is more frequently associated with actions, especially the doing of things one enjoys.
                    This is why it is important to remember that in order to find or experience one’s ikigai we need to
                    be proactive.</h5>
